			JOURNAL OF MAN,</h2>
			<p class="first_paragraph">Published from 1849 to 1856 at Cincinnati, is to be re-established at Boston in
			February, 1887. When published formerly it was in its character and merits entirely
			unique, and, notwithstanding the progress of thirty-five years, its position
			is still unique, and in its essential characteristics different from all nineteenth
			century literature, and not in competition with any other publication. It was
			needed in 1849, and it is still more needed now. It represents an entirely new
			school of thought, based upon the establishment of the new science of <strong class="name">Anthropology</strong>,
			which is a revelation of the anatomical, physiological, and psychic union
			of soul, brain, and body, and a complete portrait of man and the laws of his life,
			from which arise many forms of psychological, ethical, physiological, pathological,
			and therapeutic science, all of which are eminently practical and philanthropic
			in their results.</p>
			<p class="noteparagraph">One of these applications has been given in the volume entitled, “The New
			Education,” of which Edward Howland says, “Its results cannot fail of being
			of even more influence upon the culture and the virtue of society than the introduction
			of steam into industrial methods has had in the distribution of the
			products of skilled labor.”*</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>*Rev. B. F. BARRETT, one of the most eminent writers of his church, says:</p>
				<p>“We are perfectly <em>charmed</em> with your book. I regard it by far as the most valuable work on
				education ever published. You have herein formulated the very wisdom of heaven on the highest
				and most momentous of all themes. Your work is destined, in my judgment, to inaugurate a new
				era in popular education. It contains more and higher wisdom on the subject of which it treats
				<em>than all the other books ever written on education</em>.”</p>
			</div>
			<p>To watch and to assist the progress of humanity has been the pleasure of the
			editor for half a century, and it will be the task of the “Journal of Man,” as
			far as practicable, to present a periscope of progress in all that interests the
			philanthropist. Almost innumerable questions are arising concerning human
			rights, opinions, and interests, such as, the new education, the new theology,
			theosophy, occultism, spiritualism, materialism, agnosticism, evolution,
			paleontology, ethnology, ancient religions, systems of ethics, sociology, political
			economy, labor and wages, co-operation, socialism, woman’s progress and
			rights, intemperance and social evils of every grade, modern literature, the
			philosophy of art and oratory, revolutions in medicine, sanitary and hygienic
			science, democracy, public men and women, prison reform, the land question,
			and questions of war or peace, and national policy; upon all of which the
			“Journal of Man” must necessarily occupy an independent position, and
			present peculiar views, in the light of the new sciences of which it is the
			exponent,—views not derived from the past, not in harmony with the orthodox
			literature of the day, nor tinged by any credulous fanaticism, but resulting
			from a half century of earnest and scientific search for truth.</p>
			<p>Another important function for a philanthropic and progressive journal is
			to assist in the diffusion of liberal literature, and to keep an eye upon the prolific
			press of to-day, for the benefit of its readers, calling their attention to the
			meritorious works, which are often neglected, and warning against pretentious
			folly and sciolism. But it is not supposed that the programme of the Journal can
			be fully carried out until the completion of certain works now in hand will
			permit its enlargement.</p>
			<p>The existence and diffusion of such a science as psychometry—“the dawn
			of a new civilization,” as it is considered by its adepts and its friends,—is alone
			an imperative demand for a journal to assist the diffusion and illustration of a
			science, which no honorable and logical thinker, after accepting its well-established
			facts, can regard as anything less than the beginning of an intellectual
			revolution, the magnitude of which is astounding to a conservative mind; for
			the revolutionary science of the last forty years has been concealed from the
			conservative majority, by its exclusion from the press and from the college. But
			the “Journal of Man” has a still wider field, a task in which it may well claim the
			co-operation of all truly enlightened and philanthropic minds.</p>
			<p>It was the singular good fortune of the editor, over forty-five years ago, to
			crown his long investigations of the constitution of man by the discovery and
			demonstration that all the powers of the soul were exercised by the brain in a
			multiform subdivision of its structure, every convolution and every group of
			fibres and cells having a function appreciably distinct from the functions of all
			neighboring parts, the vast multiformity and intricacy of its structure corresponding
			to the vast multiformity and intricacy of our psychic nature, which
			has never yet been thoroughly portrayed by either philosopher or poet.</p>
			<p>The functions thus discovered are at once both psychic and physiological,
			for the brain is purely a psychic organ, when its influence is not transmitted to
			the body; but becomes a physiological organ, and in fact the controlling head
			and centre of physiological action, when its influence is transmitted, not merely
			in voluntary motion, but in the unconscious influence which sustains, modifies,
			or depresses every vital process.</p>
			<p>These discoveries were not <em>entirely</em> new, for it was the fundamental doctrine
			of Gall, the founder of the true cerebral anatomy, that the brain consisted
			of different organs of psychic functions; but in announcing the discovery (published
			from 1809 to 1819) of twenty-seven distinct organs, he fell far short of the
			ultimate truth, as a necessary consequence of his imperfect and difficult method
			of discovery by comparative development. The word <em>phrenology</em> has become
			so identified with his incomplete discoveries, that it may be laid aside in the
			present stage of our progress. There is no monotonous repetition of function
			in nervous structures, and the possibility of subdivision of structure and
			function is limited only by our own intellectual capacities.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Dr. Gall did not ascertain the functions of the basilar and internal
			regions of the brain, which were beyond the reach of his methods, and
			entirely overlooked the fact that the brain is the commanding centre of physiology,
			the seat of the external and internal senses, and of organs that control the
			circulation, the viscera, the secretions, and all their physiological and pathological
			phenomena, as demonstrated in my experiments, which reveal the entire
			physiological and the entire psychological life, with the anatomical apparatus
			of their intimate union.</p>
			<p>The experiments on intelligent persons, by which these discoveries were
			made and demonstrated, have been repeated many thousand times. They have
			been officially presented during many years in medical colleges, and sanctioned
			by scientific faculties as well as by committees of investigation, none of which
			have ever made an unfavorable report. They have been tested and demonstrated
			so often that further repetition appeared needless, since the unquestioned
			demonstrations produced no result beyond a passive assent; for men’s minds
			are generally so firmly held in the bondage of habit, fashion, and inherited
			opinion, as to be incapable of entering freely upon a new realm of intellectual
			life without pecuniary motive; and investigating committees accomplished little
			or nothing important, the reason having been, as assigned by a distinguished and
			learned secretary of a medical committee in Boston, that the subject was too
			profound, too difficult, and too far beyond the knowledge of the medical profession.
			In the presence of such unmanly apathy my demonstrations were
			discontinued, as I found that only a few high-toned and fearless seekers of
			scientific truth, such as the venerable Prof. Caldwell, President Wylie, Rev.
			John Pierpont, Robert Dale Owen, Prof. Gatchell, Dr. Forry, and a score or two
			of similarly independent men and women, have spoken to the public with proper
			emphasis of the immortality of the discovery and the greatness of the total
			revolution that it makes in science and philosophy,—a revolution so vast as to
			require many pages to give its mere outline, and several volumes to give its
			concise presentation. The subjects of these volumes would necessarily be
			Cerebral Psychology, Cerebral Physiology, Psychological Ethics or Religion,
			Pneumatology, Psychic Pathology, Sarcognomy, Psychometry, Education, and
			Pathognomy. A <em>very concise</em> epitome of the whole subject in 400 pages was
			published in 1854, as a “System of Anthropology.” “The New Education” was
			published in 1882. “Therapeutic Sarcognomy”—the application of sarcognomy
			to medical practice—was published in 1884, and the “Manual of Psychometry”
			in 1885.</p>
			<p>The discoveries constituting the new anthropology stand unimpeached
			to-day, sustained by every complete investigation, and not refuted or contradicted
			by the innumerable experiments of medical scientists. The labors of Ferrier,
			Fritsch, Hitzig and Charcot, become a part of the new system, as they lend
			corroboration; and the annals of pathology furnish numerous corroborative
			facts. These are not barren, abstract sciences, but bear upon all departments
			of human life—upon education, medical practice, hygiene, the study of
			character, the selection of public officers, of partners, friends, and conjugal
			companions,—upon religion and morals, the administration of justice and government,
			penal and reformatory law, the exploration of antiquity, the
			philosophy of art and eloquence, and the cultivation of all sciences except the
			mathematical. Anthropology must, therefore, become the guide and guardian of
			humanity, and, as such, will be illustrated by the “Journal of Man.” It will
			indulge in no rash ultraism or antagonism, but will kindly appreciate truth
			even when mingled with error. There is, to-day, a vast amount of established
			science to be respected and preserved, as well as a vast amount of rubbish in
			metaphysical, theological, sociological, and educational opinions, that requires
			to be buried in the grave of the obsolete. The greatness of our themes forbids
			their illustration in a prospectus, which can but promise an unfailing supply of
			the novel and wonderful, the philanthropic and important, the interesting and
			useful, presented in that spirit of love and hope which sees that earth may be
			changed into the likeness of heaven, and that such progress is a part of our
			world’s remote but inevitable destiny.</p>
			<p>Let it be remembered that science, philosophy, and religion are false and
			worthless when they do not contribute to the happiness and elevation of mankind,
			and that the chief factor in human elevation is that wise adaptation of
			measures to human nature which is utterly impossible without a thorough
			understanding of man,—in other words, without the science of anthropology,
			for the lack of which all national and individual life has been filled with a
			succession of blunders and calamities. It is especially in the most brilliant
			portion of anthropology, the science of psychometry, that we shall find access
			to the reconstructive wisdom which leads to a nobler life in accordance with
			the laws of heaven, as well as the prosperity and success which come from the
			fulness of practical science and the perfection of social order. For the truth of
			these unusual claims the reader is referred to “The Manual of Psychometry,”
			“The New Education,” “Intelligent Public Opinion” and future publications.</p>
			<p>The “Journal of Man” will be published at $1.00 per annum, in advance, in
			monthly numbers of thirty-two pages, beginning in February, 1887. Subscriptions
			should be sent, not in money, but by postal order, to the editor, Dr. J. R.
			Buchanan, 6 James Street, Boston. Advertisements inserted at the usual rates.

				<p><strong>Buchanan’s “Journal of Man.”</strong> “Perhaps no journal published in the world is so far in
				advance of the age.”—<cite>Plain Dealer, Cleveland</cite>.</p>

				<p>“His method is strictly scientific; he proceeds on the sure ground of observation and experiment;
				he admits no phenomena as reality which he has not thoroughly tested, and is evidently
				more desirous to arrive at a correct understanding of nature than to establish a system….
				We rejoice that they are in the hands of one who is so well qualified as the editor of the Journal
				to do them justice, both by his indomitable spirit of research, his cautious analysis of facts, and
				his power of exact and vigorous expression.”—<cite>New York Tribune</cite>.</p>

				<p>“This sterling publication is always welcome to our table. Many of its articles evince marked
				ability and striking originality.”—<cite>National Era, Washington City</cite>.</p>

				<p>“It is truly refreshing to take up this monthly…. When we drop anchor and sit down to
				commune with philosophy as taught by Buchanan, the fogs and mists of the day clear up.”—<cite>Capital
				City Fact</cite>.</p>

				<p>“This work is a pioneer in the progress of science.”—<cite>Louisville Democrat</cite>.</p>

				<p>“After a thorough perusal of its pages, we unhesitatingly pronounce it one of the ablest
				publications in America.”—<cite>Brandon Post</cite>.</p>

				<p>“To hear these subjects discussed by ordinary men, and then to read Buchanan, there is as
				much difference as in listening to a novice performing on a piano, and then to a Chevalier Gluck
				or a Thalberg.”—<cite>Democrat Transcript</cite>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blurb">
				<p><strong>Buchanan’s “System of Anthropology.”</strong> “We have no hesitation in asserting the great
				superiority of the form in which it is presented by Dr. Buchanan, whether we regard its practical
				accuracy or its philosophical excellence.”—<cite>American Magazine of Homœopathy</cite>.</p>

				<p>“The author has long been known as a distinguished Professor of Physiology, whose name
				is identified with one of the most remarkable discoveries of the age, the impressibility of the
				brain…. We are confident Buchanan’s ‘Anthropology’ will soon supersede the fragmentary
				systems of Gall and Spurzheim, the metaphysicians and phrenologists.”—<cite>Daily Times, Cincinnati</cite>.</p>

				<p>“Beyond all doubt it is a most extraordinary work, exhibiting the working of a mind of no
				common stamp. Close students and hard thinkers will find in it a rich treat, a deep and rich
				mine of thought.”—<cite>Gospel Herald, Cincinnati</cite>.</p>

				<p>“They have had sufficient evidence to satisfy them that Dr. Buchanan’s views have a rational,
				experimental foundation, and that the subject opens a field of investigation second to no other in
				immediate interest, and in the promise of important future results to science and humanity.”—<cite>Report
				of New York Committee (<strong class="name">Wm. Cullen Bryant</strong>, Chairman)</cite>.</p>

				<p>“If he has made a single discovery in physiology, he has made more than any previous explorer
				of that science, in furnishing us this key to the whole of its principles, by his cerebral and corporeal
				experiments.”—<cite>Report of the Faculty of Indiana University</cite>.</p>

				<p>“No person of common discernment who has read Dr. Buchanan’s writings or conversed with
				him in relation to the topics which they treat, can have failed to recognize in him one of the very
				foremost thinkers of the day. He is certainly one of the most charming and instructive men to
				whom anybody with a thirst for high speculation ever listened.”—<cite>Louisville Journal (edited by
				<strong class="name">Prentice</strong> and <strong class="name">Shipman</strong>)</cite>.</p>

				<p>“To Dr. Buchanan is due the distinguished honor of being the first individual to excite the
				organs of the brain by agencies applied externally directly over them, before which the discoveries
				of Gall, Spurzheim, or Sir Charles Bell—men who have been justly regarded as benefactors of
				their race—dwindle into comparative insignificance. This important discovery has given us a key
				to man’s nature, moral, intellectual, and physical.”—<cite>Democratic Review, New York</cite>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blurb">
				<p><strong>“Therapeutic Sarcognomy.”</strong> “In this work we have the rich results of half a century of
				original thought, investigation, and discovery. Upon the psychic functions of the brain, Professor
				Buchanan is the highest living authority, being the only investigator of nature who has
				done anything important for that neglected realm of science, to which the world was introduced
				by the genius of Gall and Spurzheim. This work is really a complete exposition of the great mystery,
				the united operation and structural plan of soul, brain, and body.”—<cite>Medical Advocate, New
				York</cite>.</p>

				<p>“Of the very highest importance in the healing art, is a work just issued by the venerable
				Professor Buchanan. We have read the book from cover to cover with unabated attention;
				and it is replete with ideas, suggestions, and practical hints, and conclusions of eminent value to
				every practitioner who is himself enough of a natural physician to appreciate and apply them….
				Having been cognizant of the very valuable and original work accomplished by Professor
				Buchanan in physiology, and having seen him demonstrate many times, on persons of all grades
				of intellectual and physical health, the truths he here affirms, the subject has lost the sense of
				novelty to us, and is accepted as undoubtedly proven.”—<cite>American Homœopathist, New York</cite>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blurb">
				<p><strong>“Manual of Psychometry:</strong> The Dawn of a New Civilization.” (2d edition.) “The like of
				this work is not to be found in the whole literature of the past…. His name stands honorably
				among those who have extended the real boundaries of knowledge.”—<cite>Home Journal, New York</cite>.</p>

				<p>“As an experimental science it is likely to make its way to <em>universal</em> recognition. But the
				recognition of psychometry involves a <em>tremendous change</em> in the opinions of the world, the teachings
				of colleges, and the prevalent doctrines of science and philosophy.”—<cite>Health Monthly, New
				York</cite>.</p>

				<p>“The friends of Professor Buchanan have been waiting now thirty years for him to make a
				proper public presentation of his greatest discovery,—psychometry, a discovery which the future
				historian must place among the noblest and greatest of this great epoch of human thought….
				Every branch of the Theosophical Society should have a copy, and study the book carefully.”—<cite>Theosophist,

		<h2 class="title">Salutatory.</h2>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Kind</span> reader! Let me presume that you are in search of truth,
		and that you have an intuition sufficient to tell you that this
		unending search is the inspiring energy of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>
		Let us realize the vastness of truth, the vastness of those realms of
		knowledge heretofore unexplored by man, in which the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> is
		to perform its work, and in realizing that, it will be very obvious that
		no single number of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> can be an adequate specimen to
		give a just conception of what it is to be, how many hundred themes
		it will have to consider, how many errors to analyze, how many new
		suggestions to introduce, how many criticisms of the old, how many
		expositions of the new. The present number of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> is
		little more than a promissory note for its future.</p>

		<p>Even as a commentary on periodical literature, there will be a
		countless number of the superficial theories of ignorance and haste
		for it to examine, while there will be the more pleasing task of
		noting the introduction of sound philosophy, the progress of careful
		investigation, the uprising of common sense against hereditary falsehood,
		and the gradual enlightenment of the clerical, medical, and
		educational professions by the slow progress of new ideas, and the
		unembarrassed progress of the physical sciences and inventions which
		encounter no collegiate hindrance, excepting this, that the average
		liberal education, as it is called, gives so little knowledge of physical
		science, that the educated classes often fail to distinguish between
		the real inventor and the deluded, or delusive, impostor.</p>

		<p>The inventor is the emancipator of mankind from the oppressive
		burden of toil, and hence the philanthropist should ever look with
		interest to the progress of invention, should ever be ready to cooperate
		with inventive genius. The <cite class="name">Journal</cite> should be the
		inventor’s friend, and it hopes to see the time when the national
		institution that I have proposed shall be established, to bring blind,
		but all powerful, capital into co-operation with the wise, but often
		powerless, inventor.</p>

		<p>Invention is the physical, as philosophy is the intellectual power,
		to complete the emancipation of mankind from slavery and suffering.
		“No,” would the theologian say, “your false philosophy ends in
		nothing. The world has been full of philosophies from Democritus
		to Hegel, and they have never lifted a single straw’s weight from
		the burden that oppresses all humanity. The real burden is sin, and
		religion alone can remove that, and bring in the kingdom of heaven
		on earth.”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"></a>Most true, Oh theologian, it is, that the false philosophies, from
		Democritus to Hegel, have done nothing for mankind but to becloud,
		bewilder, and enfeeble their intelligence, for the philosophies were
		born of empty vanity, which essayed to conquer the universe by
		cogitation without science, and not from any loving impulse to
		make life wiser and better. But your theologies have been almost
		as false as the philosophies. You have inverted the simple and
		pure religion of Jesus. You have taught the world that its governing
		power was not an infinite love, but an infinite hate, and that the
		chief purpose of creation was to furnish an unlimited amount of
		human agony, in eternal progress, to gratify the infinite tyrant, and,
		at the same time, please a few humble vassals whom terror alone had
		driven into his service. You have taught mankind, all too successfully,
		to imitate this superhuman monster, by the banishment, imprisonment,
		murder, or torture, of all who did not accept your
		insane and heartless teachings; and the bloody drama, which has
		been in full progress for at least fifteen centuries without one interval
		of pity or remorse, is coming to its end now, Oh theologians, simply
		because your power has waned, and mankind have partially outgrown
		their superstitious ignorance. Tennyson in his last poem has
		expressed the truth:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>“‘Love your enemy, bless your haters,’ said the Greatest of the great,</p>
				<p>Christian love among the churches looked the twin of heathen hate.</p>
				<p>From the golden alms of blessing, man had coined himself a curse;</p>
				<p>Rome of Cæsar, Rome of Peter,—which was crueler, which was worse?”</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>You are beginning, Oh theologians, to be ashamed of the history
		of your tribe, and to doubt in your own hearts the horrid creeds
		you are still teaching; and a few have even thrown them off entirely
		and joined in the movement of emancipation,—even Andover is
		uneasy beneath its old yoke. But the chief problem of progress is
		still to get rid of your creeds, and return to that simple, universal
		religion, of which Jesus was the most powerful teacher,—a religion
		that had no church, no creed, no intolerance, and which dealt only
		in that universal love to which all human souls respond when they
		receive it.</p>

		<p>Yet never has this simple religion of Jesus appeared, nor any
		effort towards its imperfect realization, without provoking orthodox
		hostility; and never has science taken one bold step in advance to
		understand the Bible of creation, or the Divine wisdom embodied
		in the constitution of man, without finding all orthodox power
		arrayed against each step of progress, and your orthodox anathemas
		ready for each fearless seeker of the truth.</p>

		<p>Never had astronomy, never had geology, never had phrenology,
		never had anthropology, one smile from the organized theological
		guardians of the ancient falsehood called orthodoxy. Neither had
		political liberty any better treatment than mental liberty. Neither
		the white man, the red man, nor the black man found friendship or
		protection until very recently in any orthodox church, for the church
		was invariably the ally of the despot. Witness all European history,
		witness the history of Mexico and South America,—witness the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"></a>history of the United States,—witness the present condition of
		Europe, groaning under the mountain load of taxation to pay war
		debts, to sustain the cannon foundries, forts, ships, barracks, and, in
		a word, the <em>armament of hell</em>, for it is but a grand, prearranged plan
		for further homicide and devastation; and all—all, alas! established
		and sustained by a government inspired by the church, which falsely
		claims to represent the principles of Christ in its terribly apostate
		career!</p>

		<p>With a loathing and horror that words cannot express I turn from
		this scene—in which, though latent at this moment, there lie all the
		horrors of the Roman amphitheatre, and wars of the legions of
		Scipio, Marius, Tiberius, Cæsar, Nero, Severus, Decius, Valerianus,
		of Alaric, Attila, and Genghis Khan—to the dawn of liberty, peace,
		and enlightenment on the American continent, where, though old
		forms and institutions may survive, their interior nature or life is
		changed,—where the apostate church is slowly relinquishing its
		apostacy and growing into harmony with modern liberty and
		progress.</p>

		<p>The time is coming, I trust, when Christian churches in the
		United States shall return to follow the sublime examples of the
		founders of Christianity; shall practise and diffuse that spirit of
		love in which is all freedom, all toleration and co-operation; shall
		welcome science and philosophy, and become the centre of all cooperative
		efforts for human amelioration.</p>

		<p>The ameliorations of the last hundred years are so great that we
		may well anticipate still greater changes in the coming century; for,
		as Whittier says:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>“Still the new transcends the old,</p>
				<p>In signs and tokens manifold.”</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>It is reasonable to anticipate this change, because the old battle
		between religion and science, which placed each in a false position,
		must come to an end. The battle is still in progress,—there is still
		an antagonism; and scientists will object to the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>
		because its science is associated with religion; while theologians
		will object to its religion because based on science; but the contest
		now proceeds with diminishing rancor, and there have been minor
		reconciliations or truces between scientists and theologians. But
		finally the grand reconciliation must come from this, that when
		science advances into the psychic realm,—when it demonstrates
		the existence of the soul, and demonstrates that heaven is not a
		morbid dream but a splendid reality,—the religious sentiment will
		recognize such science as its friend; and when science goes farther,
		and interprets the Divine laws as written by omnipotent wisdom in
		the constitution of man, more plainly and far more fully than they
		have ever been expressed in religious writings, then will religion
		perceive that such science is the Divine messenger before whom it
		should bow in reverence, and whose every utterance should be held
		sacred.</p>

		<p>It is thus the mission of anthropology to enlighten religion, to
		interpret the Divine law, and to reign in the kingdom of heaven,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>to which it is to lead us; and it is the mission of the <cite class="name">Journal of
		Man</cite> to present and keep before the enlightened few the guiding
		wisdom of anthropology.</p>

		<h2 class="title">The Phrenological Doctrines of Dr. Gall.</h2>
		<p class="subtitle">THEIR PAST AND PRESENT STATUS.</p>

		<p>Science ought to emancipate mankind from the control of the
		animal instincts, and in the purely physical and mathematical
		sciences it does. In mathematics, dynamics, optics, acoustics,
		astronomy, electricity, engineering, and mechanics, the dictates of
		pure intellect are seldom interfered with by any blind impulse,
		attraction, or prejudice. But it is very different in the realm of
		opinion—in matters in which reason should be supreme, with
		as absolute authority as number and form have in mathematics.</p>

		<p>A thousand can measure and calculate, and can obey implicitly in
		thought the mathematical laws, for one that can reason and obey
		implicitly the dictates of pure reason. If an error is made in the
		construction of a bridge, erection of a house, or financial report of a
		bank, thousands may at once detect the error, and by clear exposition
		compel its recognition. But in matters of opinion controlled
		by reason, there is no such ready detection and recognition of error,
		even by the best educated classes. The realm of opinion is ever
		in chaos. Contradictory opinions are ever clashing; no supreme
		arbiter is known; no law of reason, like the laws of mathematics,
		comes in to dissipate error and delusion.</p>

		<p>Why is this? Anthropology replies that reason is as positive,
		clear, and imperative as mathematical principles, but that men have
		not been educated to exercise and to obey the faculty of reason, as they
		have been to measure and to count. In matters of opinion, feeling
		and impulse are allowed to dominate over reason, and to hug the
		delusions which reason would dispel. We have <em>no educational system</em>,
		no college, in which the art of reasoning is properly taught, although
		the shallow pedantry of Aristotelian logic has assumed to teach the
		art of reasoning. The faculties themselves of our colleges do not
		understand or practice the true art of reasoning, for if they did, they
		would harmonize in opinion as mathematicians harmonize in calculations,
		and would lead the onward march of mind continually,
		making or accepting discoveries of the highest importance, instead
		of standing, as they do, impregnable castles of ancient error in
		matters of opinion, though moderately progressive in physical
		science.</p>

		<p>It is for these reasons that popular opinions and opinions of universities
		are of little value. Everything else but reason dominates
		them. The gift of a founder, the decree of a king, parliament, or
		pope, the decision of some ancient conclave of the superstitious and
		ignorant, or the imperious will of some interested body of lords,
		plutocrats, monks, or political usurpers, establishes the mould in
		which opinions are cast; and the soft brains of inexperienced and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>unreflective youth are easily compressed into the form of the
		established mould, and from that deformed condition they seldom
		or never entirely recover true symmetry. Never taught to reason
		deeply or accurately, they yield to the sympathetic mesmeric control
		of social opinions and impulses, without looking to their origin,
		Hence the lamentable fact that in matters of opinion or philosophy,
		as in social amusements and fashions, the animal instinct of gregariousness
		rules, and men move in masses like herds of sheep or buffaloes.</p>

		<p>These considerations prepare us to appreciate justly the value of
		former and contemporary opinions in reference to the science of the
		brain.</p>

		<p>The mystery that surrounded its anatomy was dispelled by Dr.
		Gall, and modern scientists have been building upon the foundation
		laid by him. It is not necessary now to dwell upon his protracted
		and careful study of the comparative development of the brain in
		men and animals. Suffice it to say no naturalist was ever more
		diligent, fearless, and successful, in the study of nature; and the
		conclusive evidence of his success is the fact that no student of
		nature who travelled after his footsteps has failed to see what he
		saw, and recognize Gall as a grand, original teacher.</p>

		<p>Why is it, then, that the reputation of Gall and his discoveries of
		mental organs in the brain has been so fluctuating? Why have the
		discoveries that came forward with so imposing a prestige at the
		beginning of this century so entirely lost that prestige in the colleges
		in sixty years, that the writings of Gall and his disciples are generally
		neglected? Vague, unscientific speculations have taken their
		place; the colleges and literati are groping in darkness, and, like
		plants in a cellar which reach out to the dim windows, they look
		anxiously for the information that may come from laboratories and
		anatomical halls, where animals by thousands are tortured to find
		the sources of <em>physical</em> functions, forgetful of the fact that the human
		brain is a <em>psychic</em> organ, and that <em>a whole century of such investigations</em>
		would leave the grand problems of <em>conscious</em> life and character
		in primeval darkness!</p>

		<p>Have they no respect for the labors and honorable observations of
		clear-headed scientists fifty to eighty years ago? Were the anatomists
		Reil and Loder deceived when they testified to Gall’s wonderful
		discoveries in anatomy? Were Andral, Broussais, Corvsart, and
		others, who stood at the head of the medical profession in France,
		deceived when they were followers of Gall? Was Dr. Vimont
		deceived when the study of the animal kingdom converted him from
		an opponent to a supporter of Gall? Were Elliotson and Solly of
		London, the Combes of Scotland, Macartney of Ireland, and a
		full score of others in the highest ranks of medical science deceived
		in giving their testimony that the anatomy of the brain, its development
		in the healthy, its amply recorded pathology, revealed in
		hospitals, and its phenomena in the insane asylums and prisons,
		supported the doctrines of Gall?</p>

		<p>They were not deceived, and they were not blind. <em>They were
		observers.</em> Their successors, sinking into the agnosticism of pseudoscience,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>have thus sunk because they have abandoned the methods
		of science to adopt the methods of ignorant partisanship. They
		have not studied the comparative development of the brain in
		connection with character, and therefore they know little or nothing
		of it. They are not competent as observers of development, because
		they have never attempted to become acquainted with it. Even so
		eminent a writer as the late Prof. W. B. Carpenter shows by his
		writings, which are a monument of laborious erudition, that he did
		not understand so simple a matter as the external form of the
		cranium belonging to the development of the cerebellum.</p>

		<p>Cranioscopy, the study of the brain and its proportional development
		through the cranium, which is the method by which Gall made
		his discoveries, is a <em>lost art</em> in the medical profession, and I doubt if
		there is a single professor in any American or European medical college
		to-day, who has a competent knowledge of it. The art of cranioscopy
		requires as its basis a correct knowledge of the anatomy of the brain
		and skull, a correct knowledge of the localities of all the cerebral
		organs, and a practical skill in determining their development with
		accuracy. A variation of one eighth of an inch in development will
		change the destiny of the individual, and incorrect conceptions of
		the growth of the brain and the natural irregularities of the cranium
		would vitiate the conclusions of the observers. A somewhat famous
		but unscientific practitioner of phrenology gave a good illustration
		of this by mistaking a rugged development of the lambdoid suture
		for an enormous organ of combativeness, and ascribing to the gentleman
		a terrific, pugnacious energy which was the very opposite of
		his true character.</p>

		<p>The sciolism of popular phrenology, scantily supplied with
		anatomical knowledge, and but little better supplied with clear
		psychic conceptions, is incapable of commending the science to the
		esteem of critical observers, and of course incapable of sustaining
		its reputation against the overwhelming opposition of medical
		colleges. Thus rejected or at least neglected in the universities,
		which supply its place with worthless metaphysics, and unsustained
		before the public,—for the tone of literature is controlled by the
		universities,—it is not strange that the grand discoveries of Gall
		are neglected as they are to-day.</p>

		<p>The objections to Gall’s discoveries which have been considered
		sufficient, have generally been the offspring of ignorance and superficial
		thinking. Thousands of physicians have been misled by professors
		of anatomy thoroughly ignorant of the subject, who have
		shown to their own ignorant satisfaction how impossible it was to
		judge of the development of the brain through the skull. The
		attacks upon phrenology have been generally remarkable for their
		logical feebleness. Any one well acquainted with the science and
		the phenomena in nature, could have made a much more effective
		attack,—an attack which would have <em>appeared</em> entirely unanswerable;
		but no such attack has been made.</p>

		<p>There has been, however, one <em>valid</em> objection to the discoveries of
		Gall, which has done much to discredit the whole system. He
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a>ascribed to the entire cerebellum the sexual function alone, in doing
		which he disregarded the facts developed by vivisection. Ample
		observation has shown his error. The cerebellum is the physiological
		as the cerebrum is the psychic brain, and a defined central
		portion of the cerebellum at the median line does exercise, in
		connection with the summit of the spinal cord, the sexual functions.
		This has been fully established by pathology, as well as by my own
		experiments. In this matter Gall is certainly entitled to the credit
		of <em>approximating</em> the truth, the function being located within the
		territory assigned it.</p>

		<p>The fundamental doctrine, however, which Gall has the immortal
		honor of establishing, is that the cerebrum is not a homogeneous
		unitary organ, but a mass of distinct organs, as distinct as the sensitive
		and motor columns of the spinal cord, and exercising <em>different
		mental functions</em>. Whatever errors of detail he may have fallen into
		cannot obscure the glory of the pioneer in the anatomy and psychology
		of the brain. His anatomical doctrines have stood the test
		of time; they are established; and his psychic doctrines are as near
		an approach to absolute truth as ever was made by a pioneer in
		a wilderness of mystery. Gall himself, with the just self-respect
		which belongs to a sincere and fearless seeker of scientific truth,
		expressed his attitude as follows, at the close of the sixth volume of
		his works:—</p>

		<p>“These views of the qualities and faculties of man are not the
		fruit of subtile reasonings. They bear not the impress of the age
		in which they originate, and will not wear out with it. They are
		the result of numberless observations, and will be immutable and
		eternal like the facts that have been observed, and the fundamental
		powers which those facts force us to admit. They are not only
		founded on principles deduced from individual facts, but are confirmed
		by each individual fact in particular, and will forever come
		off triumphant from every test to which they may be submitted,
		whether of analysis or synthesis. If the reasonings of metaphysicians
		are ever discarded, this philosophy of the human qualities and faculties
		will be the foundation of all philosophy in time to come.”</p>

		<p>These are the words of a grand-souled philosopher, who <em>knew</em> that
		he was speaking the truth, and forcing, as if at the point of the
		bayonet, a great, new truth upon the stolidity of the colleges. The
		simple truth of fibrous structure in the brain, now known to every
		tyro in anatomy, was contested in the days of Gall and Spurzheim,
		and had to be enforced by public dissection in an Edinburgh amphitheatre.
		With the same unreasoning stolidity the doctrine of the
		multiplicity of organs in the brain was shunned, evaded, or denied,
		though it would seem idiotic for any physiologist to assume such a
		position (by suppressing his own common sense) when the aim of
		all modern investigations of the brain is to discover different functions
		in different parts.</p>

		<p>The great doctrine of the multiplicity of cerebral organs, introduced
		by Gall, could not be suppressed or ignored among those who
		investigate the brain in any manner. All modern investigators
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>tacitly recognize it, for none could so stultify themselves as to
		assume the brain to be a homogeneous unit in either structure or
		functions, while seeking to discover the peculiar functions of each
		part. Thus his fundamental ideas are adopted by his opponents, and
		step by step they will be compelled to admit his general correctness,
		and his grand services as the pioneer in the highest department of
		science, the most prolific in important results to mankind. “Every
		honest and erudite anatomist,” says Sir Samuel Solly in his standard
		work on the anatomy of the brain, “must acknowledge that we are
		indebted mainly to Gall and Spurzheim for the improvements which
		have been made in our mode of studying the brain. For my own
		part, I most cheerfully acknowledge that the interest which I
		derived from the lectures of Dr. Spurzheim at St. Thomas’ Hospital
		about the years 1822 and 1823, has been the inciting cause of all
		the labor which for above twenty years I have at intervals devoted
		to this subject.”</p>

		<p>The organ of language, his first discovery, located at the junction
		of the front and middle lobes, has been the first to receive the
		general recognition of the medical profession, because it is easy to
		recognize its failures in disease, and the morbid condition of its
		organ.</p>

		<p>Its general recognition by physiologists now is not usually accompanied
		by any reference to Gall as its discoverer. They are probably
		not aware that he located it correctly, because he referred so much
		to its external sign in the prominence of the eyes. This prominence
		of the eyes indicates development of the brain at the back of their
		sockets. The external marking of organs is to indicate where they
		lie and in what direction their development produces exterior projection.
		The junction of the front and middle lobes, including the so-called
		“island of Reil” (who was a pupil of Gall, and spoke of him
		as the most wonderful of anatomists), has its most direct external
		indication at the outer angle of the eye. That is the location which
		has been given the organ by my experiments, which were made
		without reference to anatomy, without even a thought of it, for I
		consider such experiments the supreme authority in physiology,
		and do not stop to inquire whether any previous knowledge supports
		them or not.</p>

		<p>Dr. Gall had the true idea, for although he spoke of the general
		prominence of the eye as the indication, he also recognized the
		development as extending in the direction in which I have located
		it. He regarded the organ of language as a convolution lying on
		the super-orbital plate, behind the position of the eyeball. This
		convolution is comparatively defective in animals generally, but
		more developed in birds of superior vocal powers. In addition to
		this, he observed the growth extending into the temples, where the
		front and middle lobes unite. “A great diameter in this direction,”
		he says, “is always a favorable augury for the memory of words. I
		have seen persons who with an ordinary conformation of the eyes
		yet learned by heart with great facility. But in these cases the
		diameter from one temple to the other is ordinarily very considerable,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>and sometimes even the inferior part of the temples is projecting,
		which attests a great development of the adjacent cerebral
		parts.”</p>

		<p>Thus it is evident that he recognized the structure behind the
		external angle of the eye as an important part of the organ of
		language.</p>

		<p>The interior portion of the convolution is the more intellectual
		portion of the organ, while the exterior portion is that which holds
		the closest relation to the fibres of the <em>corpora striata</em> in the middle
		lobe, and may therefore most properly be called the organ of
		language or of speech, the impairment of which produces aphasia, or
		loss of speech. This is the form which has chiefly attracted the
		attention of the medical profession, as it very often accompanies
		paralytic affections from disease of the <em>corpora striata</em>.</p>

		<p>Evidently Gall arrived at the correct location, and he illustrates
		the discovery by referring to a great number of authors and
		scientists whose development he observed. His most decisive fact
		is the case of a patient who lost the memory of names entirely, but
		not the power of speech, by a thrust from a foil, which penetrated
		through the face, the posterior inner part of the front lobe, at its
		junction with the middle lobe, thus wounding the internal part of
		the organ of language, but not reaching the outer posterior part, at
		the island of Reil, to which pathologists have given their chief attention.</p>

		<p>Evidently Gall had the correct idea, and should have been duly
		credited by the pathologists who have verified his discovery.</p>

		<p>In verifying this discovery by excitement of the organs, I find
		the centre of language behind the external angle of the eye, on each
		side of which, toward the nose and toward the temples, are analogous
		functions which might, if we did not analyze closely, be included
		with it, as portions of the organ of language.</p>

		<p>The discoveries of Gall, though no longer sustained by colleges
		or phrenological societies, have never lost their hold upon the
		students who follow his teachings and study nature. A few phrenological
		writers and lecturers maintain the interest among those
		they reach, but our standard literature generally ignores the
		doctrines, and forgets the name of Gall. Yet the eclipse is not total.
		It will pass away as this century ends, and the fame of the great
		pioneer in science will be immortal, for it rests not on any wave of
		eighteenth century opinion, but is based on that which is “immutable
		and eternal.”</p>

		<p>Yet so thoroughly has the present generation of physicians been
		misled by the colleges into ignorance of the labors of Gall, that
		although they know the location of the faculty of language is now
		beyond doubt, they do not think of the discoverer or understand his
		discoveries, but vaguely suppose that Ferrier, Jackson, Fritsch,
		Hitzig, and others have entirely superseded Gall by their inferences
		from experiments on the brains of animals. In this how greatly are
		they deceived! All that modern vivisectors have done has utterly
		failed to disturb the cerebral science derived from cranial observation
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>by Gall and myself, and from direct experiment by myself. On
		the contrary, the immense labor of their researches serves only to
		add new illustrations and facts corroborating and co-operating with
		what was previously ascertained, as will be fully shown when
		“Cerebral Psychology” shall be published.</p>

		<p>It was once supposed that the intellectual functions of the front
		lobe were entirely refuted by discoveries which proved the front
		lobe the source of muscular impulses. More thorough experimenting
		dissipated this illusion. Ferrier reported that after a partial
		ablation of the front lobes in intelligent monkeys, “instead of, as
		before, being actively interested in their surroundings and curiously
		prying into all that came within the field of their observation, they
		remained apathetic or dull, or dozed off to sleep, responding only to
		the sensations or impressions of the moment, or varying their
		listlessness with restless and purposeless wanderings to and fro.
		They had lost to all appearance the faculty of attentive and intelligent
		observation.” This is precisely what the true cerebral psychology
		indicates. The imaginary muscular powers were not at all
		detected, for the section of the front lobe had no influence on the
		muscular system.</p>

		<p>The science of Gall was a science of facts relevant to great principles.
		The science of his opponents was a science of irrelevant
		facts, revealing no philosophy. Students of nature adhered to Gall;
		students of books and adherents of authority neglected him. Of
		this there is no better illustration than the great collection of
		De Ville in London, of which the following account is given in the
		admirable treatise on phrenology (of 637 pages) by Dr. James P.
		Browne of Edinburgh.</p>

		<p>“How wide and various are the channels through which the phrenologist
		derives his facts. In society, whichever way he turns, they
		are constantly being presented for his contemplation. Besides there
		is not a city or town of any note that does not contain a collection
		of authentic casts of well-known persons; and up to the year 1853, the
		gallery of Mr. De Ville, in London, contained the largest and most
		valuable phrenological collection in the world of casts and skulls of
		men and women remarkable for the greatness of their talents, or the
		peculiarities of their dispositions; including above three hundred
		busts, both antique and modern, of the most renowned men the world
		has ever seen. The whole number amounted at least to three thousand.
		About two thousand skulls of animals of every denomination
		were also to be found there. There could be seen the form of head
		which accompanied the <em>poetical instincts</em> and high moral aspirations of
		the poor peasant boy, John Clare; and how strikingly dissimilar it was
		in its most marked characteristics to the head of George Stevenson,
		one of the most original of <em>mechanical</em> geniuses. Both were self-taught,
		but one was intensely <em>active</em>, the other <em>cogitative</em>. The mind
		of Clare was constantly engaged in poetical musings upon the moral
		affections, their pains and their pleasures; that of Stevenson was
		drawn by an inherent impulse to physical objects, and perseveringly
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>devoted to the discovery of such mechanical combinations of them
		as might be of lasting benefit to society. There might be pointed
		out the cause of the difference of style which characterized the
		oratory of Mansfield and Erskine, of Canning and of Brougham:
		and that which constituted the elements of mind and their combinations,
		which raised Edmund Burke, as a prescient statesman, to a
		height such as neither Pitt, nor Fox, nor even Chatham was capable
		of reaching. There might be seen in Banks’s fine bust of him, the
		cause why Warren Hastings, though he was endowed with many
		good qualities which endeared him to his friends, was, nevertheless,
		covetous, self-willed, domineering, unjust, and, in some instances,
		pitiless, as Governor-General of India. What a contrast to this did
		the bust of the Marquis of Wellesley, by Nollekens, present. Not
		only did it indicate that the disposition of that distinguished statesman
		was unimbued with the slightest tincture of hypocrisy, avarice,
		or the love of self-willed domination, but, on the contrary, it was
		phrenologically symbolic of an instinctive carelessness in regard to
		his own pecuniary interests, a disposition which in his case, perhaps,
		amounted to a fault, and which his intellect, capacious of great
		things, and comparatively heedless of whatever is little, was ill-calculated
		to redress. There might be seen in Behnes Burlowe’s
		bust of Macintosh indications of the vastness of his intellect, and
		the unobtrusive gentleness of his disposition; whilst Chantrey’s
		exquisite bust of Lord Castlereagh afforded marked indications of
		his having been endowed with courage the most heroic, unalloyed
		by the slightest tinge of complexional fear, and with an intellect well
		balanced, devising, and industrious, but certainly narrow in its range as
		compared with that of Sir. J. Macintosh. There, too, might be seen
		the true physical indications of the imperturbable coolness of Castlereagh,
		and of the sensitiveness and warm susceptibility of Canning.</p>

		<p>“Amongst the skulls of birds how readily could the practised
		observer distinguish the skull of the tuneful, melodious canary from
		that of the chirping, inharmonious sparrow. Nor could he fail to
		mark the constant difference between the form of the head of a song
		thrush and that of the jackdaw; or to discern how the cuckoo’s
		head is hollow where the organ of the love of offspring is located,
		whilst the same part presents a striking protuberance in the partridge.
		In the dolphin, the porpoise, the seal, and many other animals,
		the male could there be distinguished from the female by the
		form of the back part of the skull, where the same organ lies. Nor
		could any one fail to mark the form of head that is the invariable,
		and evidently indispensable, concomitant of the ferocious and sanguinary
		temper of the tiger, as well as the strong contrast which it
		presents to the skull of the wild but gentle gazelle. How superior also
		the elevated brain of the poodle dog, when compared with that of the
		indocile, snarling cur! Thus in animals of the same species the
		most marked disparity of form is easily discernible, on comparing
		the skulls of such as are docile and gentle, with those of the dull and
		intractable. The elevation of the one and the depression of the other
		are obvious.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>“In an ethnological point of view that collection was very valuable.
		What a striking contrast was presented there by the rounded form
		of the skull of the fierce, indomitable American Indian, who is so
		averse to intercourse with strangers, and the rather narrow, elongated
		head of the indolent negro, who is devoted to social enjoyments.
		How wide was the difference between the head of the Sandwich
		Islander or of the Tahitian and that of the Australian or the Tasmanian.
		How much superior to either of them were the heads of
		the civilized Incas of Peru, which had not been submitted to the
		distorting process of artificial compression. Neither could the wide
		disparity between the Maori and the Gentoo escape the notice of
		the most careless observer. And how immeasurably inferior in
		form were they all to the noble head which is the issue of the mingling
		of the Celtic, Saxon, and Norman races (imbued with an infusion
		of old Roman, blood), such as it is found to be in these islands,
		and in the United States.</p>

		<p>“Perhaps it may not be considered out of place if I relate a circumstance
		of considerable interest to those who make it a point to make
		strict inquiry as to the amount of knowledge which certain races are
		capable of imbibing.</p>

		<p>“Some twenty years ago and more, when the great anatomist, Tiedemann,
		was in London, he paid a visit to De Ville’s Phrenological
		Museum. I saw him as he entered the place. He was erect and
		tall, with an air somewhat stately, yet perfectly unassuming. His
		head was not so remarkable for great size as for its fine symmetry,
		and the organs of the moral and intellectual portions of it were in a
		rare degree harmoniously blended. It was the characteristic head
		of a curious, indefatigable, conscientious inquirer into the <em>arcana</em> of
		physical things—one who was not given to indulge in unprofitable,
		visionary speculations. His visit to De Ville being strictly private,
		there was no opportunity afforded me of hearing his remarks.
		But, afterwards, it was told me by De Ville himself, that Tiedemann
		supposed (and in this he resembled all other opponents of phrenology)
		that because he had tested the capacity of a great many negro
		and European skulls, by filling them with millet seed, and found
		that, on an an average, those of the Africans were scarcely inferior
		in size to the skulls of Europeans—that from that fact he thought
		it probable that the negro, if placed in advantageous circumstances,
		ought to be capable of exhibiting powers of mind equal to the
		European.</p>

		<p>“But when the humble, self-educated follower of Gall demonstrated
		to this celebrated physiologist and anatomist that the <em>forehead</em> of the
		negro is <em>usually</em> much smaller than that of the European, and that,
		moreover, its form, with few exceptions, is irregular and ill-balanced;
		and when he showed that the size of the negro skull in the basilar
		portion, where the organs of the affections (which we possess in
		common with the lower animals) lie, was, in proportion to the upper
		and anterior parts, which are the seats of the moral and intellectual
		faculties, larger in the negro than in the European—when De
		Ville showed, by many instances, that this is always and infallibly
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>the case (with the exception of the heads of criminals), Tiedemann
		raised his hands and said, ‘The labor of years is now, I clearly see,
		of no use to me; and I must destroy many valuable things bearing
		upon this theme.’ Thus, by following the <em>true</em> mode of investigating
		this department of natural history, was an uneducated man, of
		good talents, enabled to correct a mistake in anatomy and physiology
		committed by one of the ablest anatomists that Europe has
		given birth to.</p>

		<p>“For the long term of twenty-two years the writer of this treatise
		took every opportunity, afforded him by the kindness of its generous
		owner, to study the contents of this rare collection; and, after having
		studied it with assiduous care, he is bound to say that out of the
		hundred thousand facts which it contained, not one could be pointed
		out that did not testify to the never-failing agreement of particular
		parts or organs of the brain, with certain independent, elementary
		faculties, according to the laws discovered by Gall.</p>

		<p>“It is with the view of demonstrating the stability and unchangeableness
		of those laws that the composition of this treatise has been
		undertaken; in order to excite in its regard such a degree of attention
		as will tend to awaken it from the state of inauspicious somnolency
		in which it has for some years lain prostrate. But, strongly
		impressed with a conviction of the importance of the subject, and
		fully alive to the difficulty of treating it, the writer cannot help
		being crossed by fears for the success of this attempt. Relying,
		however, upon the solidity of the foundation upon which his subject
		rests, and surveying the vast store of accumulated materials which
		have, for more than thirty years, been constantly passing through
		his hands, and the facts which are now strewn before him in whatever
		society he may be placed, he would fain hope that even his
		humble abilities will enable him to make such a selection of incontrovertible
		facts as will place beyond a doubt the possibility of determining
		the innate talents and dispositions of any one by making a
		skilful survey of the head; and, should he succeed in merely raising
		a more general spirit of active inquiry in regard to the nature of
		the evidence adduced, and the deductions drawn from it by phrenologists,
		than at present exists, he will have reaped a fair reward for
		his efforts, for he has long been thoroughly convinced that a strict
		and faithful examination of the facts which bear upon the case is
		alone requisite for converting the incredulous scoffer into the zealous
		advocate.”</p>

		<p>Having thus vindicated the claims of the great pioneer in philosophy,
		our next issue will show the limitations of his discoveries, and
		give an outline of the new and all-comprehensive Anthropology.</p>

		<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>The Great Land Question.</h2>

		<p class="subtitle">AGITATED BY HENRY GEORGE, MICHAEL DAVITT, PROF. WALLACE, DR. EADON
		AND REFORMATORY SOCIETIES IN GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">They</span> who in the fearless pursuit of truth attain ideas for which
		the age is not prepared are recognized as Utopians. The dullards
		who have not the desire, and <em>therefore</em> have not the capacity to seek
		new truth, languidly regard as dreamers the men who talk of things
		so foreign to their own habits. The more dogmatic class, inspired
		by the dogmatism of the colleges, array themselves in scorn to repel
		new thought. But, fortunately, as men die they fail to transmit
		<em>all</em> of their bigotry to posterity, and new men come in with new
		ideas.</p>

		<p>In that new world of thought to which anthropology belongs, the
		basis of social order is understood, and I felt it my duty in 1847 to
		present the law of justice in relation to “The Land and the People,”
		with very little hope that the doctrine presented would ever become
		in my own lifetime a basis of political action, since other ideas
		equally true and equally demonstrable have to bide their time.
		But the toilers who suffer from the lack of employment have furnished
		an eager audience to the land reformers, and the great land
		question is destined to agitate the nations for a century to come.
		The <cite>Boston Globe</cite> recently called attention to the original presentation
		of this subject at Cincinnati, in the following editorial:—</p>

		<p>“There seems to be a notion prevalent that the ideas advocated
		by Mr. George are novel. But they are not. They once more
		illustrate the familiar fact that there is nothing new under the sun.
		Much the same doctrines were urged here in America at least forty
		years ago, and were the subject of comment in the papers of the day.</p>

		<p>“Dr. J. R. Buchanan, now of Boston, presented the case at Cincinnati
		in 1847 much as it is now put by Mr. George and Mr. Davitt.
		The Memphis <cite>Appeal</cite> of September 23 of that year, gave an elaborate
		review of Dr. Buchanan’s essay, in which it said:</p>


		<blockquote><p>“‘The Land and the People’ is the title of a well-written pamphlet from
		the pen of Dr. J. R. Buchanan of Cincinnati, formerly known to our citizens
		as an able and accomplished lecturer on the science of neurology. It
		is quite plain from the production in question that the doctor has not confined
		himself to the study of the physiological system, of which we believe
		he is the author, but has evidently thought deeply upon other subjects
		vitally concerning the well being and progress of society. Whatever may
		be thought of the positions of this pamphlet, we cannot deny to it the merit
		of great beauty of style and force of logic. The whole argument is based
		upon the proposition that the earth is the original gift of God to man, and
		as such belongs of right to the human race in general, and not to the individuals
		of the race separately. The author insists that the land is not the
		product of man’s labor any more than air, sunshine, or water, and that originally
		this gift of God ought to have been left as free as those lighter, but
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>indispensable elements must ever be, from their very nature. The artificial
		and unnatural laws which have sprung up and become fastened upon society
		have thrown immense obstacles in the way of the bare perception of this
		great truth, as the doctor deems it, besides at the same time interposing
		barriers almost insurmountable to its reception and adoption into the framework
		of government. It is insisted, however, that these obstacles may be
		overcome, and the rights of the people restored to them, without any injustice
		to the present proprietors of land, and without any convulsions in the
		great elements of society.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>“Dr. Buchanan explained in his essay, as Mr. George does in his
		works now, that he did not mean to annul the existing titles to land.
		‘Far from it,’ Dr. Buchanan said. ‘Such a scheme would be a miserable
		climax of folly and injustice, fit only to render the great principle
		equally odious and ridiculous.’ The doctor insisted that he
		proposed to ‘maintain in legislation the broad principle that the
		nation owns the soil, and that this ownership is paramount to all
		individual claims,’ and from this fundamental proposition as a corner-stone
		the superstructure was to be built up. The present proprietors
		of the soil were not to be disturbed in their possession, and the
		government was not to interfere in the details of agriculture, renting
		and leasing estates, determining possession, etc. But the owners were
		to be considered as the tenants of the nation, paying rent to it
		for the benefit of the people at large. This rent was to be extremely
		small at first, estimated upon the value of the soil alone, without the
		improvements, that being the original gift of nature, free to all. It
		was to be increased, however, in the course of two generations, until
		a rent of about 5 per cent should have been exacted from all the
		tenants of the nation—that is, from all who occupied any portion
		of the soil. The rent thus raised—a vast revenue—was to be
		applied to the establishment of free colleges, free schools, free libraries,
		and other institutions calculated to improve and benefit the citizen.</p>

		<p>“This is the doctrine, substantially, as put forth at the present
		time by Mr. George, and by so many persons supposed to be entirely
		new. Again we remark that ‘there is nothing new under the sun.’”</p>

		<p>This subject will be taken up hereafter in the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>.
		Its progress as a policy will be noted, its writers reviewed, and the
		dictates of dispassionate science presented. It is too late to intercept
		the folly and crime that have surrendered the rights of the people
		in the American continent, but not too late to begin reclamation
		of our lost sovereignty.</p>

		<p>We shall have ample discussions of this subject. Mr. George has
		given us “Progress and Poverty” (cloth, $1.00; paper, 20 cents);
		“Social Problems,” at the same price; “The Land Question” (paper,
		10 cents); “Property in Land” (paper, 15 cents); “Protection
		or Free Trade” (cloth, $1.50). At Baltimore a volume has been
		issued as one of the Johns Hopkins University studies in political
		and historical science, written by Shosuke Sato, Ph. D., Special
		Commissioner of the Colonial Department of Japan. N. Murray is
		the publishing agent, and the price in paper is $1.00. This work is
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>a “History of the Land Question in the United States,” and
		describes the formation of the public domain by purchase and cession,
		and the entire administration of the land system of the United
		States. The land laws of early times and of other countries are
		stated in the introduction. Another very instructive work recently
		issued is entitled, “Labor, Land, and Law; a Search for the Missing
		Wealth of the Working Poor,” by William A. Phillips; published
		by Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York. Mr. Phillips has
		been a member of Congress from Kansas, and his work is an extensive
		view of the land question in other countries as well as the
		United States.</p>

		<p>In the near future this must be the burning question of politics
		and statesmanship, as it is at present in Great Britain. The agitations
		in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have long been on the verge
		of bloody conflict, and a Land League has been formed in Germany
		at Berlin, of which Dr. A. Theodor Stamm is president, having for
		its object the transfer of land ownership from individuals to the
		State. A newspaper at Berlin is devoted to its objects.</p>

		<p>A few facts show how inevitable the conflict that is coming, while
		the agricultural classes of all Europe are being driven by American
		competition deeper and deeper into poverty and inability to pay
		rent, which can never be again what it has been. The New York
		<cite>Evening Post</cite> very justly says: “The truth is, we are witnessing in
		Ireland the gradual disappearance of rent. The land is no longer
		able to support anybody but the actual cultivator. To make this
		process peaceful, and as far as possible harmless to all parties, ought
		to be the chief concern of the Government.” Landlordism in Great
		Britain has small claims upon our sympathy, for the great body of
		the land is held by titles which have no other basis than the robbery
		of old by military power. According to John Bright, in
		England and Wales one hundred persons own 4,000,000 acres; in
		Scotland twelve persons own 4,346,000 acres, and seventy persons
		own the half of Scotland; nine tenths of all the land in Scotland
		belongs to 1,700 persons, the rest of the population having only one
		tenth. In Ireland less than 800 persons own half of all the land,
		and 330 persons own two thirds of all the land in Scotland; 402
		members of the House of Lords hold 14,240,912 acres, with a rental
		of $56,865,637.</p>

		<p>It is no wonder that the tenants of the Duke of Argyle have
		risen against the police that enforce the landlord’s claims, and that
		the Welsh resistance against tithes has impoverished the Welsh
		clergy.</p>

		<p>The Irish agitation has a just basis, which was well stated by the
		Boston <cite>Herald</cite> as follows:—</p>

		<p>“The assertion has been frequently made that rents have increased
		more in England than in Ireland; but one of the ablest
		English statisticians, a man who can hardly be accused of partiality
		toward Ireland, has recently pointed out that while in the forty
		years from 1842 to 1882 the rents in England increased on an
		average 15 percent, the rents in Ireland in the same period increased
		<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>on an average 20 per cent, and this, too, in a country where farming
		has been carried on on a low scale of culture, where the landlord
		has done practically nothing for his tenant, and where the results of
		the harvest are more uncertain than in England. It is the constant
		desire that the Irish landlords have shown in the past to get the
		last pound of flesh and the last drop of blood out of their tenants
		that is the cause of the present detestation in which they are held by
		the latter.”</p>

		<p>In the United States the public domain has been criminally surrendered
		to monopoly. Commissioner Sparks speaks in his reports
		of the “widespread, persistent land robbery.” The fences of land
		robbers have been removed from 2,700,000 acres, and over 5,000,000
		will probably be redeemed. In fifteen years, 179,000,000 of acres
		have been given by Congress to various railroad corporations, a
		larger territory than the empire of Germany. Before these wrongs
		were consummated, nearly forty years ago, I called a public meeting
		in the Cincinnati court house, which protested against this surrender
		of the people’s domain. The present agitation will probably bring it
		to an end. In the Congressional debates last June Mr. Eustis said
		“the railroad men had made fortunes as mushrooms grow in the
		night; a coterie of such men had enriched themselves at the
		expense of the people of the United States. They did not observe
		equity, honesty, or good faith, and only came here to assert their
		legal rights and to defy the authority and power of Congress and the
		people of the United States to deal with them. The great question
		to-day was whether the government was superior to the corporations,
		or the corporations superior to the government. The corporations
		had exhibited shameless and unpardonable oppression and
		extortion, as well as effrontery in their dealing with the people and
		the Government of the United States.” “Our people and our country,”
		said the speaker, “were only able to stand the drafts thus
		made on their liberties because they were yet young and strong and
		vigorous.” Mr. Eustis advocated the forfeiture of every acre of
		land that had not been earned according to the strict limitations
		and conditions imposed in the grant.</p>

		<p>In the house of Representatives, December 11, 1886, Mr. Payson
		of Illinois, on behalf of the Committee on Public Lands, called up
		the bill declaring a forfeiture of the Ontonagon and Brule River
		land grant. In detailing the circumstances of the grant Mr. Payson
		declared that from the organization of the Ontonagon and Brule
		River Company no step had ever been taken by it which did not
		indicate that that organization had been purely speculative and
		effected for the purpose of getting land from the General Government.
		It had been an attempt at bare-faced robbery from its inception
		down to the present time. Referring to the statement made
		by persons interested in the road, that it had been accepted by commissioners
		and reported upon as having been built in first-class
		style, he asserted that miles of the road had no other ballast than
		ice and snow, which, melting in spring, left the rails held in suspension
		eight inches above the ground. In support of his assertion,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>he produced photographs of various sections of the road and
		commented upon them, much to the amusement of the House. A
		bridge, as depicted by the photograph, he declared to be humped
		like a camel and backed like a whale. A section of a mile in length
		showed but one railroad tie; while a 250-foot cut was shown as
		being filled with logs and brush. The bill was passed without division.
		It forfeits 384,600 acres.</p>

		<p>The march of monopoly must be arrested in the United States
		and Mexico. A New England company has obtained from Mexico
		eighteen millions of acres in lower California. All over the world
		the curse of land monopoly flourishes undisturbed. The natural
		result of landlordism everywhere is already foreshadowed in this
		country by the example of William Scully in Illinois. The Chicago
		<cite>Tribune</cite> one year ago devoted four columns to the career of Scully,
		a resident of London, who owns large tracts of American land, and
		has introduced the Irish landlord system in managing his American
		property. The <cite>Tribune</cite> said:—</p>

		<p>“Scully is one of the chief figures among the alien proprietors of
		American soil, and has introduced the meanest features of the worst
		forms of Irish landlordism on his estates in this country. He has
		acquired in the neighborhood of 90,000 acres of land in Illinois
		alone, at a merely nominal figure—50 cents to $1 per acre, as a
		rule. His career as an Irish landlord was a history of oppression
		and extortion, that was appropriately finished by a bloody encounter
		with his tenants. He was tried and acquitted on the charge of
		double murder, but became so unpopular that in 1850 he sold most
		of his Irish property, and has since devoted himself to building up a
		landlord system in Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and other States. He
		made entries of the public domain through the medium of the land
		warrants issued to Mexican war soldiers, which he purchased at the
		rate of 50 cents per acre. In Logan County, Ill., alone, he has
		40,000 to 45,000 acres. It is the almost universal testimony that
		Scully’s rule in that county has reduced 250 tenants and their
		families to a condition approaching serfdom. Furthermore, Scully
		pays no taxes, the tenants signing ironclad agreements to assume
		the same, but they are required to pay to Scully’s agents the tax
		money at the same time as the rentals—the 1st of January of each
		year; whereas, the agent need not turn over the taxes to the county
		treasurer until about June 10 following. It is suggested that
		Scully probably makes a handsome percentage on the tax money
		remaining in his hands for five months. It is also shown that a
		great deal of this alien’s land entirely escapes taxation, thus increasing
		the burden on other property holders; that he takes the most
		extraordinary precautions to secure his rent, executing a cast iron
		lease, with provisions that mortgage the tenant’s all, scarcely allowing
		his soul to escape, and making it compulsory for small grain to
		be sold immediately after harvest, no matter what may be the condition
		of the market; that grain dealers are notified not to buy of
		the tenants until Scully’s rent is paid; in short, that Scully has
		founded a land system so exacting that it is only paralleled in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>Ireland, and rules his tenantry so despotically that few can be
		induced to tell the story of their wrongs, justly feeling that it would
		involve ruin to them.”</p>

		<p>Much sympathy has been excited by the reports of cruel evictions
		in Ireland, to gratify the merciless avarice of landlords, and for the
		justice of these reports we need not depend on Irish testimony alone.
		American travellers have told enough, and the London <cite>Standard</cite> of
		Jan. 18 says: “Some of this winter’s evictions have been inhuman
		spectacles, fit only for a barbarous country and a barbarous age.”</p>

		<p>There is nothing intrinsically wrong in the relation of landlord and
		tenant, which should excite a prejudice against the landlord; on the
		contrary, many landlords have been a blessing to the communities
		in which they lived; but our land system is a conspicuous part of a
		grandly false social system based on pure selfishness, which makes all
		men jealous competitors, and destroys the spirit of fraternity.</p>

		<p>Our social system tends ever to make the rich richer and the poor
		poorer, and the struggle in Ireland is but the forerunner of a
		movement that will extend around the globe. Is there no remedy
		for the evils? Indeed there is! Sixty years of thought have made
		me familiar with the evils and the remedies. Some of the remedies
		are coming to the front at present. All will in time be presented in
		the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite>.</p>

		<p>Land reform is but one of the great measures that progress demands.
		The first and greatest is a <strong class="extra_emphasis">PERFECT EDUCATION</strong> for all,
		moral and industrial. The second is <strong class="extra_emphasis">SPIRITUAL RELIGION</strong>. The
		third is <strong class="extra_emphasis">JUSTICE TO WOMAN</strong>. The fourth, which is <strong class="extra_emphasis">JUSTICE IN LEGISLATION</strong>,
		includes land reform, financial reform, and many other
		reforms. The fifth is <strong class="extra_emphasis">INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION</strong>. The sixth is
		<strong class="extra_emphasis">TEMPERANCE</strong>.</p>

		<p>The first reform includes all the others. The second would ultimately
		bring all things right, and so would the third in a longer
		lapse of time.</p>

		<p><strong class="emphasis">Anthropology</strong> is the intellectual guidance into all reforms, and
		therefore should precede all. Hence it is the leading theme of this

		<p>Horace Greeley sympathized with such movements, and about
		forty years ago gave much space in the <cite>Tribune</cite> to the illustration
		of this subject. Although the co-operative principles of Fourier,
		then widely discussed, have not resulted in any great success in
		community life in the United States, it can also be said that experiments
		have not shown the doctrines of Fourier to be impracticable.
		The best thinkers have not lost their faith, and the example of M.
		Godin at Guise in France, with a population of 1,800 in the Social
		Palace enjoying the very Utopia of happy and prosperous co-operative
		life, is a splendid demonstration of what is possible, and a
		standing rebuke to the churches of civilized nations which have not
		even noticed this grand demonstration of the possibilities of
		humanity.</p>

		<p>The grandest and most hopeful co-operative scheme yet proposed
		is that of Mr. Albert K. Owen, entitled the “Credit Foncier of Sinaloa,”
		which has been established at the harbor of Topolobampo,
		in the state of Sinaloa, on the western coast of Mexico, where a
		large and liberal grant has been obtained from the Mexican government
		for the Credit Foncier Company, chartered by the state of
		Colorado, Mr. Owen being chairman of the Board of Directors. Its
		headquarters were at rooms 7 and 8, 32 Nassau Street, New York,
		and the members of the community are already gathered in considerable
		numbers at Topolobampo. The Credit Foncier of Jan.
		11 reports over 4,800 persons enlisted for the colony, and over
		sixteen thousand shares of stock sold.</p>

		<p>This is not a unitary community, in which the individuality of
		the members is lost, but a co-operative corporation, owning its lands as
		a society, and abolishing at once the primary evils of land monopoly
		and a false financial system. As stated by Mr. E. Howland, “the
		community is responsible for the health, usefulness, individuality,
		and security of each member, and at the same time each will feel
		secure in his social and individual rights in the existence of the collective
		ownership and management for public utilities and conveniences,
		instead of the disorganized chaos in which to-day we
		live.”</p>

		<p>A system of distribution will be adopted, doing away with the
		immense cost of trade as at present conducted. The laborer will be
		protected against misfortune by a system of insurance and a pension
		in old age. Employment and opportunity will be provided for all,
		and education provided for all children. It is upon this education
		that the <em>ultimate</em> success of the society must depend, for it is impossible
		to organize a perfect society of those whose characters have
		been moulded by the present antagonistic condition of society. All
		grand ideals must look to the future for their realization. That
		such realization may occur in the Sinaloa colony is indicated by the
		following quotation from the exposition of the Credit Foncier by
		Mr. Howland.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>“As we shall have to, at least during this generation depend upon
		the colonization of persons who have been subject to the influences
		of society as it is, we would only say, that the new truths concerning
		moral education contained in ‘The New Education’ by Mr. J. R.
		Buchanan, have been carefully examined by the writer of this, and
		its most important lessons shall be applied in the organization of our
		schools; for the power of love can be unquestionably applied,
		not only as a cure for the evils produced inevitably by the
		system of competition, but also as a miraculous agent in aiding
		the progress of society to an inconceivably higher plane of human
		life.”</p>

		<p>The newspaper in exposition of the society entitled, “The Credit
		Foncier of Sinaloa,” published at $1 a year, at Hammonton, New
		Jersey, will be issued hereafter at Topolobampo, Mexico. A
		report descriptive of the site of the colony and the surrounding
		country (price six cents) and a map of the colony’s site (price ten
		cents) may be obtained by addressing the editor, E. Howland, at
		Topolobampo, Mexico.</p>

		<p>While the Journal is going through the press, the colonists are
		gathering in large numbers, and by our next issue we may have
		some account of the commencement of this noble enterprise.</p>

		<p>Its founder, Mr. A. K. Owen, is a gentleman of great energy and
		enterprise, guided by noble principles, a skilful surveyor and engineer.
		About fourteen years ago he made extensive exploration in
		Mexico, especially on its Pacific Coast, discovered and reported
		Topolobampo Bay, and introduced the scheme of the Norfolk &amp;
		Topolobampo Railroad, which he urged upon the attention of Congress,
		winning the approbation of committees, but finally defeated
		by the great railroad corporations. He took an active part in
		Mexican affairs, forming gigantic plans for the public welfare, by a
		syndicate at the head of which was Gen. Torbert, which were defeated
		by a shipwreck in which Gen. Torbert was lost, and himself
		narrowly escaped death. He then organized with the co-operation of
		Gen. Grant, Gen. Butler, and other distinguished men, the “Texas,
		Topolobampo &amp; Pacific Railroad and Telegraph Company,” and
		obtained a concession of 2,000 miles of railroad and a subsidy of
		$16,000,000. Hon. Wm. Windom was president, and Mr. Owen
		chief engineer. In 1873 he located a hundred miles of the road
		from Topolobampo eastwardly, and two years ago the construction
		commenced. Thus in the midst of a life of great activity and experience
		in engineering, finance, politics, reform, and travel, Mr.
		Owen, as a practical and skilful manager of great undertakings,
		inspired by a strong democratic philanthropy, has laid the plan of
		a co-operative colony on the basis of liberal concessions from the
		Mexican government, and opened a field in which his democratic
		ideas of human rights, of land, labor, finance, hygiene, freedom, and
		general reform, can have full scope.</p>

		<p>Mr. Owen’s ideas and plans are stated in a book of two hundred
		pages, published by Jno. W. Lovell, 14 Vesey Street, New York, and
		sent by mail for thirty cents. It is not a systematic treatise, but a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>miscellaneous collection of documents which give a good deal of
		information.</p>

		<p>The Topolobampo scheme is one requiring great skill and executive
		ability in the directors, as well as a harmonious and energetic
		spirit in the colonists. The climate, soil, and opportunities are no
		doubt the best that have ever been accorded to a scheme of co-operation,
		and when its success has been realized, it may be accounted
		the most important social event of the century, for it will be the
		dawn of peace to a warring world, the promise of harmony between
		all the restless and convulsive elements of civilized society.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Health and Longevity.</h2>

		<p><span class="first_word">Upon</span> these subjects the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> has a new physiological
		doctrine to present, which may be stated in the initial
		number, and will be illustrated hereafter.</p>

		<p>In the volume of “Therapeutic Sarcognomy,” which was so
		speedily and entirely sold upon its publication, it was clearly demonstrated
		that the doctrine of vitality taught at this time in all
		medical colleges is essentially erroneous, and that human life is
		not a mere aggregate of the properties of the tissues of the human
		body, as a house is an aggregate of the physical properties of bricks
		and wood, but is an influx, of which the body is but the channel
		and recipient.</p>

		<p>That demonstration need not be repeated just now, as my object
		is merely to state the <em>position</em> of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite>. Life is an influx
		from the world of invisible power, aided by various forms of influx
		from the material world, without which it would promptly cease.
		If this naked statement should seem fanciful or erroneous to any
		reader, he may be just to himself by suspending his opinions until
		he shall have received the demonstration. We have all been
		educated into false opinions on this subject, and it is almost as difficult
		for the American scholar to release himself from the influence
		of education and habit in such matters, as for the Arab to release
		his mind from the influence of the Koran.</p>

		<p>It has been only within the last ten years, and as the sequel of investigations
		of the seat of life beginning in 1835, that I succeeded
		in ascertaining the absolute falsity of the doctrines on this subject
		maintained by all scientific biologists at the present time, and demonstrating
		that the human body is only a tenement, of which life is
		the builder, and which drops into decay when life deserts it to meet
		its more congenial home in a nobler realm.</p>

		<p>It is not therefore in the physical but in the spiritual constitution
		that the real basis of his character, his health, and longevity is
		to be found, for the primitive germ or protoplasm of man cannot
		be distinguished from that of a quadruped or bird. It is the invisible
		and incalculable life element that contains the potentiality or
		possibility of existence as a quadruped or a man, as a virtuous or
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>vicious, and as a long lived or short lived, being. The life element of
		the germ limits the destiny of the being. That life element is invisible.</p>

		<p>This truth, however, does not contradict the truth of development
		and the capacity of science to estimate the probable health or
		longevity of an individual from his organization, for the life force
		organizes a body in accordance with its own character; and the
		development of the entire person shows the character of the vital
		force as modified by the environment of food, air, motives, and education.
		The brain, no less than the body,—indeed, more fully than
		the body,—shows the elements of the life and the tendency to
		health and longevity, or the reverse, upon which an expert cranioscopist
		can give an opinion.</p>

		<p>In accordance with the doctrine of influx and in accordance with
		the functions of the brain we are compelled to recognize health and
		longevity as more closely associated with the higher than the lower
		faculties,—the moral rather than the animal nature. This is the
		reason that woman, with a feebler body but a stronger moral nature,
		ranks higher in health and longevity than man; and although from
		four to sixteen per cent more males are born, women are generally
		in predominance, often from two to six per cent. The researches of
		the Bureau of Statistics of Vienna show that about one third more
		women than men reach an advanced age. De Verga asserts that of
		sudden deaths there are about 100 women to 780 men. The inevitable
		inference is that the cultivation of virtue or religion is the
		surest road to longevity, and the indulgence in vice and crime the
		most certain ruin to the body and soul.</p>

		<p>There is a curious illustration of these principles in the evidence
		of life insurance companies in reference to spirit drinking and
		abstinence. The oldest two life insurance companies of England,
		the General Provident and the United Kingdom, have made records
		for forty-five years which distinguish the total abstainers and the
		moderate drinkers. Drunkards they do not insure at all. The care
		with which lives are selected for insurance results in a smaller rate
		of mortality among the insured than in the entire population. This
		gain was but slight among those classed as moderate drinkers, for
		their mortality was only three per cent less than the average mortality;
		but among the total abstainers it was thirty-one per cent less.
		Thus the proportion of deaths among moderate drinkers compared
		to that of total abstainers is as 97 to 69.</p>

		<p>The temperance advocate would assume that this was owing entirely
		to the deleterious effects of alcohol, and that is partially true;
		but there is a deeper reason in the difference of the two classes of
		men. The man in whom the appetites are well controlled by the
		higher energies of his nature, and who has therefore no inclination
		to gluttony or drunkenness, has a better organization for health and
		longevity than he in whom the appetites have greater relative power,
		and who seeks the stimulus of alcohol to relieve his nervous depression.
		The inability or unwillingness to live without stimulation is
		a mark of weakness, which is an impairment of health; and this
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>weakness predisposes to excessive and irregular indulgence, though
		it may not go so far as intoxication.</p>

		<p>The effects of marriage furnish a parallel illustration. It is well-known
		that bachelors are more short lived than married men, but
		this is not owing <em>entirely</em> to the hygienic influence of marriage. It
		is partly owing to the inferiority of bachelors as a class. The men
		who remain celibate are either too inferior personally to win the
		regard of women, or are generally deficient in the strong affections
		which seek a conjugal life, and the energies which make them fearless
		of its responsibilities and burdens. Evidently they have not as
		a class the robust energies of the marrying men, and the urgent
		motives to compel them to regular industry and prudence. Everything
		which stimulates men to exercise the nobler qualities of their
		nature is promotive of health and longevity; and the <em>true</em> religion
		which anthropology commends will increase human longevity in
		proportion as it prevails.</p>

		<p>In future numbers the true basis and indications of longevity in
		man will be fully illustrated.</p>

		<p>The attainable limits of human longevity are generally underrated
		by the medical profession and by popular opinion. Instead of
		the Scriptural limit of threescore and ten I would estimate twice
		that amount, or 140 years, as the ideal age of healthy longevity,
		when mankind shall have been bred and trained with the same wise
		energy that has been expended on horses and cattle. Of the
		present scrub race, a very large number ought never to have been
		born, and ought not to be allowed to transmit their physical and
		moral deficiencies to posterity.</p>

		<p>The estimate of 140 years as a practicable longevity for a nobler
		generation is sustained by the number of that age (fourteen, if I
		recollect rightly) found in Italy by a census under one of the later
		Roman emperors. But for the race now on the globe a more applicable
		estimate is that of the European scientist, that the normal
		longevity of an animal is five times its period of growth,—a rule
		which gives the camel forty years, the horse twenty-five, the lion
		twenty, the dog ten, the rabbit five. By this calculation man’s
		twenty years of growth indicate 100. But growth is not limited to
		twenty, and if we extend the period of maturing to twenty-eight,
		the same rule would give us 140 as an age for the best specimens of
		humanity, which has been attained in rare cases, its general possibility
		in improved conditions being thus demonstrated.</p>

		<p>There are many fine examples of longevity at this time. The
		famous French chemist Chevreul has just completed his hundredth
		year at Paris, in the full vigor of his intellect.</p>

		<p>The <cite>Novosti</cite>, a Russian journal, recently mentions the death in the
		almshouse of St. Petersburg of a man aged 122 years, whose mental
		faculties were preserved up to his death, and who had excellent
		health to the age of 118.</p>

		<p>We have similar examples in the United States. Mrs. Celia Monroe,
		a colored woman, who died a few weeks ago at Kansas City was believed
		to be 125. She was going about a few days before her death.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>Farmer O’Leary of Elkton, Minnesota, is over 112. Noah Raby
		of Plainfield, New Jersey, is in his 115th year. He supports himself
		by his work in the summer, and looks like a man of 80.</p>

		<p>Of very recent deaths we have: Amos Hunt of Barnesville,
		Georgia, who died at 105, leaving twenty-three of his twenty-eight
		children. Mrs. Raymond of Wilton, Connecticut, was still living
		recently in her 106th year. Ben Evans, part Indian, part negro, a
		great hunter of Wilkes County, Georgia, died at 107; baptized after
		he was 100. Mrs. Betsy L. Moody died on the 4th of July in Cape
		Elizabeth, Maine, aged 104. Wm. Henry Williams of Cincinnati,
		died a few months ago at 102. James Fitzgerald of Prince
		Edwards Island, over a hundred years old, is still able to work.
		Mrs. Lydia Van Ranst lately died on East 16th Street, New York,
		aged 100 years and ten months; and Mrs. Johanna O’Sullivan in
		Boston in her 103d year. Mrs. Betsy Perkins of Rome, N. Y.,
		was apparently in excellent health when she died suddenly at the
		breakfast table in her 101st year. Rev. Hugh Call died in Wayne
		County, Indiana, at 104. After his hundredth year he once fancied
		death was near, and sent for his family to see him die; but when
		they arrived in midwinter, they found the old man busy cutting
		wood to make a fire for his visitors.</p>

		<p>Many of these examples show that the faculties of both soul and
		body ought to be maintained in good condition to the last, as fruit
		falls from the trees ripe and perfect. When we leave our earthly
		tenement, we ought to leave it in a respectable condition, and not
		carry any infirmities from it to the better world.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Remarkable Fasting.</h2>

		<p>“<span class="first_word">Signor</span> Merlatti, a young Italian, completed in December his
		fifty days’ fast, at the Grand Hotel, Paris, in time to enjoy the festivities
		of the holidays. Unlike his rival, Succi, he partook of no
		mysterious elixir, but existed on water alone. At the conclusion of
		his feat, he was so nearly dead that the surgeons were anticipating
		by way of dissection more light on the effects of privation from food.
		He was barely able to move about without help. His stomach was
		unable to hold any solids, and at the big banquet over which he
		presided he could not have had a very convivial time, as he was
		unable to take a mouthful of food. He has since gradually recovered.
		Succi, meanwhile, is engaged in another fast. He fences and
		takes any amount of exercise, to show that his mysterious liquid is
		what does it.”</p>

		<p>This is a little over the record of Dr. Tanner, but the result is
		very different. Dr. Tanner came out in good condition, with a
		splendid and healthy appetite. In the first twenty-four hours he
		ate something every hour or two, indulging largely in watermelons,
		milk, apples, beefsteak, potatoes, English ale, and Hungarian wine.
		He gained eight and a half pounds weight in thirty hours. Everybody
		was astonished, and the doctors were confounded; the crowd
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>cheered, and the music resounded as the fast was finished and the
		feasting began in Clarendon Hall, the doctor being in as good
		health and spirits as when he began, except as to physical strength.</p>

		<p>Now it is proper to mention what I believe has not before been
		published, having been carefully concealed by Dr. Tanner. As he
		was encountering the whole force of a brutal prejudice in the medical
		profession, and trickery and falsehood were used to defeat him
		by Dr. Hammond and Dr. Landon C. Gray, (a shabby story indeed,
		if the whole truth is ever told,) Dr. Tanner did not think it safe to
		elicit any additional hostility by confessing his mediumship.</p>

		<p>The whole performance was a <em>triumph of spiritual power!</em> Dr.
		Tanner came to me in New York to aid him in giving a demonstration
		of his fasting power, which had been denied in an insolent and
		scurrilous manner by Dr. Hammond and others. Dr. Hammond,
		with a great deal of duplicity and unfairness, evaded the test, and it
		was carried out with the aid of other parties in a very satisfactory
		manner.</p>

		<p>The organization of Dr. Tanner was not such as I would have
		selected for a fasting performance, and he did not undertake it on
		his own resources alone. He was thoroughly a medium, and, when
		in my parlor, Indian spirits would take control of him, and carry him
		through a lively performance, speaking through his lips, and promising
		to sustain him through the fast; and they did. I have no doubt
		that with a suitable organization, such as is more frequently found
		in India than in America, a fast could be sustained by spirit power
		for six or twelve months. Indeed, there are records of such fasts in
		the old medical authors, which are omitted in all recent works. The
		spirit of dogmatic scepticism had carried the medical profession
		generally into such a depth of ignorance on these subjects that Dr.
		Landon C. Gray declared that a forty days’ fast had never occurred,
		and that if Dr. Tanner attempted it, it must be assumed “that he
		will cheat at every turn.”</p>

		<p>The kind of sentiment cultivated by colleges in the medical profession
		was shown by the deportment of the medical visitors. The
		report of the fast says:—</p>

		<p>“The most curious episodes, probably, on the whole, were afforded
		by the appearance of sceptics, and members of the medical profession
		from the country. Many of the latter came long distances to
		satisfy their respective curiosity, or vent their scepticism, as the case
		might be. As a rule they were long-visaged, not a few were unkempt,
		and many were downright seedy in wearing apparel. Almost
		invariably they insisted upon boring the doctor with numberless
		questions, many of which were idle. The majority displayed ignorance,
		and it might truthfully be said, they were rude almost without
		exception. One man insisted upon feeling Dr. Tanner’s arms
		and legs; another wanted to feel his pulse; a third demanded a view
		of his tongue; a fourth declared food must be given to him surreptitiously,
		else he would be dead; a fifth wanted to search his
		pockets; the sixth asserted his professional reputation (<em>sic</em>) that
		there was fraud about the whole business; the seventh had some
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>patent surgical, or other appliance, which he wished to test upon
		the patient; and yet another wanted to analyze even the water he
		used, before the faster drank it.</p>

		<p>“The effect of these boors in their constant inroads upon a fasting
		man, whose surroundings and conditions were not of the best, to say
		the least, may be easily imagined. When these fanatics were prevented
		by the watchers from extracting what little of life was left in
		the object of their devotions, their indignation took various forms of
		expression. As a rule they denounced the whole thing as a humbug,
		and every one participating as frauds. Now and then it became
		positively necessary, in common decency and self-respect, to show
		these charlatans the way to the door, notwithstanding their protests
		that they had paid twenty-five cents for the purpose of ventilating
		their empty heads. As a general thing, by Dr. Tanner’s direction,
		the admission fee was returned to these people. Even on the thirty-ninth
		day, when the doctor desired all the quiet he could obtain, one
		of these gentry, who said he was a physician from Long Island,
		talked so loudly that he had to be called to order, and then nothing
		daunted, he asked the faster to go in his enfeebled condition to the
		south gallery, where his writing materials were, to prepare an
		autograph for the applicant. The <cite>Herald</cite> reporter on watch at the
		time, through whom the request was made for the autograph, gave
		the fellow a settler by remarking, that he, as a layman, thought the
		first rudiments taught in the medical profession, were those of feelings
		of humanity.</p>

		<p>“Then the wits had their time of it. They showered in caricatures
		and doggerel by the barrel. None enjoyed these more than the
		doctor himself. By his direction the funniest of the cartoons were
		pasted against the wall of the gallery in which the doctor slept and
		the watchers sat. Above the whole was the legend in German text,
		‘Tanner Art Gallery,’ and during the closing days and hours of the
		fast it was a source of much attraction and a great deal of merriment
		to the thousands of visitors who sought the place.”</p>

		<p>Before the fasting began I witnessed an amusing specimen of the
		medical scepticism. One of the medical visitors inspected the hall
		closely, and finding in the back part that a piece of nearly worn out
		carpet remained on the floor, proceeded to rip it up and tear it away,
		as if he suspected there might be a trap door concealed.</p>

		<p>Medical education has been miserably cramped and benighted by
		the total ignoring of the nobler element of the human constitution.</p>

		<h2 class="title">Cerebral Psychology.</h2>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> comprehensive system of science developed by experiment
		on the brain, perfected by psychometric exploration, demonstrated
		by pathognomy, corroborated by personal experiences and the sensations
		of the head, enforced and illustrated by the study of comparative
		development throughout the animal kingdom, based upon anatomy,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>illustrated by pathology, and proven by every examination of
		a living head, as well as every scientific experiment upon the brain
		in sensitive and intelligent persons, has now been for forty years in
		the hot crucible of experimental physiological investigation by vivisection,
		ablation, autopsy, and electricity, and still remains as the
		solid gold of eternal science.</p>

		<p>The labors of Ferrier, Fritsch, Hitzig, Schiff, Bastian, Charcot,
		and others, have added many valuable facts; but no new fact can contradict
		a fact previously well observed, and nothing has occurred to
		dethrone the founder of cerebral science, Dr. Gall, who ranks immeasurably
		beyond all his contemporaries, and who prepared the way for
		the full development of Cerebral Psychology, resulting from the discovery
		of the <em>impressibility of the brain</em>, which has opened the entire
		realm of <em>cerebral psychology</em>, and through that has given us access to
		every realm of wisdom.</p>

		<p>The long expected and long promised work upon this subject cannot
		be published now, for it requires an amount of elaborate research
		and criticism to bring the new discoveries <em>en rapport</em> with the investigations
		of more than a hundred physiologists and anatomists,
		whose labors should not be overlooked in a complete or systematic
		work uniting anatomy to psychology.</p>

		<p>Under these circumstances it is necessary and practicable, since
		my “System of Anthropology” has been entirely out of the market
		for thirty years, to present a concise exposition of cerebral psychology
		and physiology, to satisfy those who perceive the inadequacy of the
		Gallian system, and who are aware that my discoveries have thoroughly
		revolutionized as well as enlarged cerebral science, rendering
		the old term phrenology inadequate to express its present status.</p>

		<p>I propose therefore to publish in the successive numbers of this
		Journal a concise “Synopsis of Cerebral Science,” giving as concisely
		as possible the outlines of that vast theme, in so clear and
		practical a manner that each reader can test its truth in nature by
		examining character, correcting the errors of phrenology, demonstrating
		the science by his own experiments, and applying its principles
		in the treatment of disease, in experimental investigation, in
		education, self-culture, and elocution. This may satisfy the urgent
		present demand, until time shall permit a satisfactory work, containing
		the illustrations and proofs, the important modern discoveries in
		cerebral anatomy and vivisecting experiments, as well as the vast
		and interesting philosophy into which we are led by cerebral
		science. The March number will contain the first instalment, and

		<h2 class="title">Music.</h2>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> claims of music were never so thoroughly presented as in the
		“New Education,” in which it was shown that music was the most
		effective of all agents for the cultivation of man’s higher nature, and
		the elevation of the world from its purgatory of selfishness, poverty,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>and crime. This idea was most fully realized by <em class="name">Mrs. Elizabeth
		Thompson</em>, who has spent a considerable amount in promoting the
		currency and use of music, especially of a religious character.</p>

		<p>The idea that music should exercise a world redeeming power, and
		promote all social advancement, must appear strange, when first
		mentioned to those who are familiar only with fashionable operatic performances
		and the heartless style of vocal and instrumental music
		in vogue at the centres of musical education, which is robbed as
		thoroughly as possible of all ethical life, all soul inspiring power.</p>

		<p>There is music, however, which sways our noblest emotions,
		which can bring smiles to the face or tears to the eyes, hope to the
		dejected or courage to the timid,—which can rouse the strongest
		impulses of love and duty. The musical reformer who shall change
		the tide of popular music from its present low channels to that
		higher sphere of sweet and noble sentiments, will be far more than
		a Wagner,—aye, more than a Luther.</p>

		<p>Dr. Talcott, Superintendent of the Middleton, N. Y., State
		Asylum of the Insane, has introduced music into all of the wards of
		his institution with excellent results, judging from his last annual
		report, from which the following is extracted. “It is said, that
		before Moses dwelt upon the banks of the Nile, the Egyptians
		erected temples and altars for the treatment of the insane; and,
		among the most notable measures for the accomplishment of the
		cure of lunatics, music took an exalted rank. There can be no
		doubt that music exercises a potent influence in producing calm and
		restfulness in minds which are disturbed by cerebral diseases.
		Musical instruments have been provided in nearly every ward, and
		the results have been most favorable. Even turbulent patients will
		subside when the pleasures of music are afforded to them. One of
		the most effective attendants we ever had upon our disturbed wards
		was a good musician. After his work was done, he would sit down
		among his patients, and play upon the violin. Immediately the
		most excited persons in the ward would group themselves about him,
		and listen with profound attention so long as he continued to play
		for them. Where good music can be provided for the turbulent
		insane, there exists but little necessity for restraint of a physical
		nature.”</p>

		increasing throughout Christendom, and far more where the boasted
		influences of modern education and the so-called progress are most
		fully realized. The whole fabric of education and society is unsound,
		and this is proved by the results.</p>

		<p>A true civilization advancing in wisdom must develop the ability
		to correct its own evils, but the civilization that we have is drifting
		on, downward and helpless.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>The philosophy of insanity and the philosophy of its remedial
		treatment can be found only in the profound study of the brain, and
		its relations to the soul and body. But there is not a glimmer of
		the psychic science of the brain to-day in our colleges. In due time,
		this theme shall be discussed in the Journal.</p>

		<p>A proper understanding of this subject will show what method of
		life and thought tends toward insanity, and by what methods we
		escape it. It will show also the relation of disease to insanity, and
		the proper methods of moral and physical treatment.</p>

			<p><strong class="headline">Our Narrow Limits and Future Tasks.</strong>—As the Journal
			goes to press I realize vividly how utterly inadequate a dollar
			monthly is for the expression of the new philosophy, even in the

			should contain. A large amount of desirable matter is necessarily
			excluded. Nevertheless a modest beginning is prudent; for the vitality
			of a young journal, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, is as
			delicate as that of an infant. It is to be hoped that the friends of
			progress will secure patronage enough to the Journal this year to
			justify its enlargement in 1888. Meantime the minister whose circuit
			embraces many stations cannot visit them all each week. In
			like manner the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> has too large a circuit to
			approach each of its themes every month. The science of man
			being the highest and most comprehensive of themes, occupies the

			<p><strong class="headline">Palmistry.</strong>—Mr. E. Heron-Allen, a very intelligent gentleman
			from England, with a fashionable prestige, has been interesting the
			fashionables of New York and Boston in palmistry, or, as he calls it,
			cheirosophy, with considerable profit to himself. The human constitution
			is so unitary in itself that every portion reveals much of
			the whole. Physicians learn a great deal from the globules of the
			blood, others draw many inferences from the excretions. The
			amount of study given to the hand renders it probable that palmistry
			may have considerable value as a physiognomic science. As
			it comes now in a fashionable style it may flourish, but of course it
			<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>was only a vulgar imposture when practiced by gypsies. Circumstances
			alter cases.</p>

			occult science.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="miscellany_item" id="misc5">
			<p><strong class="headline">Apparitions of the Dead.</strong>—Prof. Barrett of the English
			Psychical Research Society, states that: “It has been demonstrated
			almost as certainly as has been the law of gravitation, that scores of
			cases have occurred where some persons in one town, have, at a certain
			hour or minute, seen the figure of a friend flit across the room,
			and have afterwards discovered that at that very hour and minute
			the friend breathed his last in a distant town, or, may be, in a
			foreign country. Now these cases are inexplicable by any formula
			of science, yet that they have happened is scientifically proved.”</p>

			<p>Notwithstanding the good intentions of some of the members of
			that society, its general conduct has been so unfair in its investigations
			that Stainton Moses, the vice-president, has felt it to be his
			duty to resign and withdraw. The truth is, the pioneers in philosophy
			can expect no cordial co-operation and no real justice from their

			In prison it was found that she was in a hypnotized condition, and

			<p><strong class="headline">Men who Live in Trees.</strong>—Dr. Louis Wolf, who made the sensational
			discovery a while ago that the Sankuru River afforded a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>more direct and more easily navigated route to Central Africa than
			the Congo, made another discovery in the course of the same
			journey which was quite as remarkable if not so important. On the
			banks of the Lomami River, far toward the centre of the continent,
			he says he found whole villages that were built in the trees. The
			natives, partly to protect themselves from the river when in flood,
			and partly to make it more difficult for their enemies to surprise
			them, build their huts on the limbs of the trees where the thick
			foliage almost completely hides the structures from view. The inmates
			possess almost the agility of monkeys, and they climb up or
			descend from their little houses with astonishing ease. It is believed
			they are the only Africans yet known who live in trees.</p>

			<p>In Borneo some of the natives are said to live in trees, and Mr.
			Chalmers, in his book on New Guinea, tells of a number of tree
			houses that he visited on that island. These huts, which are built
			near the tops of very high trees, are used for look-out purposes, or
			as a place of refuge for women and children in case of attack.
			They are perfect little huts with sloping roofs and platforms in front,
			to which extends the long ladder, by means of which the natives
			reach the huts. Mr. Gill describes one of these houses which was
			used as a residence. He says it was well built, but that it rocked
			uncomfortably in the wind.</p>

			<p><strong class="headline">Protyle.</strong> The address of Professor William Crookes before the
			British Association, upon the “Genesis of the Elements,” is one of
			the most important contributions to chemical philosophy that has
			been published for a long time. Reasoning from the recently discovered
			law of periodicity among the elements, he discusses the
			possibility of their being formed from the cooling of one primitive
			form of matter, which he calls <em>protyle</em>. While he admits that we
			have no direct evidence that the elements are different manifestations
			of the same form of matter, yet he thinks that the observed phenomena
			of chemistry and physics point very strongly to such a conclusion,
			and agrees with Faraday, that, “to decompose the metals,
			then to reform them, to change them from one to another, and to
			realize the once absurd notion of transmutation, are the problems
			now given to the chemist for solution.” We consider Professor
			Crookes to be one of the most eminent scientists now living, and

		<p><span class="first_word">Every</span> departure from the stereotyped plan of humanity is an
		interesting proof of the vast capacities of nature, and therefore a
		prophecy of possible variation and grander development for the
		coming generations; hence the hairy family—Moung Phoset, his
		mother, Mahphoon, and the giant Winkelmeier—are deeply interesting
		to the anthropologist.</p>

		<p><em class="name">Winkelmeier</em>, according to the <cite>London Standard</cite>, is now in
		London at the Pavilion, standing <em>eight feet, nine inches high</em>, a foot
		higher than Chang, the Chinese giant, and evidently the tallest man
		living. He was born in 1865, in Upper Austria. Neither his four
		brothers, parents, nor grandparents, are unusually tall. He is
		healthy, strong, and intelligent, and is expected to continue
		growing.</p>

		<p><em class="name">Moung Phoset</em>, and his old mother, <em class="name">Mahphoon</em>, whose pictures
		are here given, are now in London on exhibition. They were the
		hairy family of King Theebaw of Burmah, and when Theebaw was
		captured by the British army, they escaped to the jungle, where
		they were robbed by Dacoits, but were recovered by Captain Piperno,
		and brought to England. Moung Phoset, like his mother, has
		his face and entire body covered by long, fine hair, from five to
		twelve inches long, which even fills the ears, and on the forehead is
		so long that it has to be drawn back over the ears to uncover the
		eyes. He is an intelligent and well-behaved man, and has a fair
		Burmese education. His wife, however, is a common Burmese
		woman. Moung Phoset, having no children, is the last of a hairy
		species, which it is said, originated in his great grandfather, who was
		caught wild in the forest between Upper Burmah and Siam.</p>

		<p>Hairy irregularities, according to Darwin, are associated with
		irregularities of the teeth. In Moung Phoset the molar teeth are
		deficient.</p>

		<div class="ad_narrow">
			<p>The <strong class="name">Business Department</strong> of the Journal
			deserves the attention of all its readers, as it will be
			devoted to matters of general interest and real
			value. The treatment of the opium habit by Dr.
			Hoffman is original and successful. Dr. Hoffman
			is one of the most gifted members of the medical
			profession. The electric apparatus of D. H. Fitch
			is that which I have found the most useful and satisfactory
			in my own practice. Bovinine I regard as
			occupying the first rank among the food remedies
			which are now so extensively used. The old drug
			house of B. O. &amp; G. C. Wilson needs no commendation;
			it is the house upon which I chiefly rely for
			good medicines, and does a very large business with
			skill and fidelity. The <cite>American Spectator</cite>, edited
			by Dr. B. O. Flower, is conducted with ability and
			good taste, making an interesting family paper,
			containing valuable hygienic and medical instruction,
			at a remarkably low price. It is destined
			to have a very extensive circulation. I have
			written several essays in commendation of the
			treatment of disease by oxygen gas, and its
			three compounds, nitrous oxide, per-oxide and

			<h3 class="title">College of Therapeutics.</h3>
			<p>The large amount of scientific and therapeutic
			knowledge developed by recent discoveries, but not
			yet admitted into the slow-moving medical colleges,
			renders it important to all young men of
			liberal minds—to all who aim at the highest rank
			in their profession—to all who are strictly conscientious
			and faithful in the discharge of their
			duties to patients under their care, to have an
			institution in which their education can be completed
			by a preliminary or a post-graduate course
			of instruction.</p>

			<p>The amount of practically useful knowledge of
			the healing art which is absolutely excluded from
			the curriculum of old style medical colleges is
			greater than all they teach—not greater than the
			adjunct sciences and learning of a medical course
			which burden the mind to the exclusion of much
			useful therapeutic knowledge, but greater than
			all the curative resources embodied in their instruction.</p>

			<p>The most important of these therapeutic resources
			which have sometimes been partially
			applied by untrained persons are now presented
			in the College of Therapeutics, in which is taught
			not the knowledge which is now represented by
			the degree of M. D., but a more profound knowledge
			which gives its pupils immense advantages
			over the common graduate in medicine.</p>

			<p>Therapeutic Sarcognomy, a science often demonstrated
			and endorsed by able physicians, gives the
			anatomy not of the physical structure, but of the
			vital forces of the body and soul as located in every
			portion of the constitution—a science vastly more
			important than physical anatomy, as the anatomy
			of life is more important than the anatomy of
			death. Sarcognomy is the true basis of medical
			practice, while anatomy is the basis only of operative
			surgery and obstetrics.</p>

			<p>Indeed, every magnetic or electric practitioner
			ought to attend such a course of instruction to
			become entirely skilful in the correct treatment of
			disease.</p>

			<p>In addition to the above instruction, special
			attention will be given to the science and art of
			Psychometry—the most important addition in
			modern times to the practice of medicine, as it
			gives the physician the most perfect diagnosis of
			disease that is attainable, and the power of extending
			his practice successfully to patients at any
			distance. The methods of treatment used by
			spiritual mediums and “mind cure” practitioners
			will also be philosophically explained.</p>

			<p>The course of instruction will begin on Monday,
			the 2d of May, and continue six weeks. The fee
			for attendance on the course will be $25. To
			students who have attended heretofore the fee will
			be $15. For further information address the
			president,</p>

			<p class="sign">JOSEPH RODES BUCHANAN, M. D.<br />
			<span class="address name">6 James St., Boston.</span></p>

			<p>The sentiments of those who have attended these
			courses of instruction during the last eight years
			were concisely expressed in the following statement,
			which was unanimously signed and presented
			to Dr. Buchanan by those attending his last
			course in Boston.</p>

			<p>“The undersigned, attendant, upon the seventh
			session of the College of Therapeutics, have been
			delighted with the profound and wonderful instructions
			received, and as it is the duty of all who
			become acquainted with new truths of great
			importance to the world, to assist in their diffusion,
			we offer our free and grateful testimony in the
			following resolutions:</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the lectures and experiments of
			Prof. Buchanan have not only clearly taught,
			but absolutely demonstrated, the science of Sarcognomy,
			by experiments in which we were personally
			engaged, and in which we cannot possibly
			have been mistaken.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we regard Sarcognomy as the
			most important addition ever made to physiological
			science by any individual, and as the basis
			of the only possible scientific system of Electro-Therapeutics,
			the system which we have seen
			demonstrated in all its details by Prof. Buchanan,
			producing results which we could not have believed
			without witnessing the demonstration.</p>

			<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That Therapeutic Sarcognomy is a
			system of science of the highest importance, alike
			to the magnetic healer, to the electro-therapeutist,
			and to the medical practitioner,—giving great
			advantages to those who thoroughly understand it,
			and destined to carry the fame of its discoverer to
			the remotest future ages.”</p>
